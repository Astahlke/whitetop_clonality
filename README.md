Manuscript in prep here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XPrNPiisYU6e_6AW0RspCsISu7R80YDJJ4aF3MP1IkU/edit

# Code
## analysiscode.Rmd 
 Examines environmental variation across and within sites. Tests for relationship between environmental variation and clonality. 

## To-do:
### Devlop repo for reproducibility
- upload raw ecological and genetic data
- upload genetic data processing scripts
### Analysis 
- characterize spatial (genetic) structure within sites:
  - what is the average distance between clones? 
  - what is the degree of aggregation? phalanx or guerilla growth? 
  - what is the degree of patchiness/edges within sites? related to heterogeneity?
